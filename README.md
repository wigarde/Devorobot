# Devotest
Welcome to the devoteam robot programming assignment

First you will be prompted to enter the width and height of the room.
This should be entered as two integers seperated by a space, like '20 15'

After this you will be prompted to enter the staring position of the robot and also the directions it's facing currently.
This should be entered as two integers and a char seperated by a space, like '10 5 N'
The starting position needs to be inside the room that was created earlier and the direction needs to be either N, E, S or W. 

Lastly you will be prompted to enter the navigation of the robot.
This should be enteres as a series of either 'L' for left, 'R' for right or 'F' for forward, like FFLLFRRFFL

If the robot gets out of bound an error will be thrown to the end user of where it has gone out of bounds.
