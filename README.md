# Devotest
Welcome to the devoteam robot programming assignment
First you will be prompted to enter the width and height of the room.
This should be entered as two integers seperated by a space, like '20 15'

After this you will be prompted to enter the staring position of the robot and also the directions it's facing currently.
This should be entered as two integers and a char with no delimiter needed, like '75N'
The starting position needs to be inside the room that was created earlier and the direction needs to be wither N, E, S or W.
